# Decentralized Reputation System

A blockchain-based reputation system built on Ethereum using Solidity and Foundry, enabling users to rate each other in a trustless, transparent manner.

## Overview

This decentralized reputation system allows users to build and maintain reputation scores through peer-to-peer ratings. The system implements anti-gaming mechanisms, dispute resolution, and weighted scoring to ensure fair and reliable reputation tracking.

### Key Features

- **Peer-to-Peer Rating**: Users can rate each other on a configurable scale
- **Weighted Reputation**: Ratings from higher-reputation users carry more weight
- **Anti-Gaming Protection**: Cooldown periods, Sybil resistance, and rating limits
- **Dispute Resolution**: Built-in mechanism for challenging unfair ratings
- **Reputation Decay**: Time-based reputation decay to keep scores current
- **Profile Management**: User profiles with metadata and rating history
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for system administration
